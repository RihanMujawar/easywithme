# easywithme

A lightweight UI component showcase and starter kit for building and previewing reusable HTML/CSS/JS components.

## Features
- Collection of navbar, login, input, card and button components
- Live preview loader for each component
- Small JS utilities for theme toggle, search, and copy-to-clipboard
- Component examples include isolated HTML/CSS/JS files for easy reuse

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/easywithme.git
2. Open the project in VS Code:
   code easywithme
3. Open index.html in a browser or use a static server:
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   Visit http://localhost:8000

## Development
- Edit component files under `components/`
- Main app logic lives in `script.js` and component registry in `components.js`
- To test changes quickly, refresh the preview iframe or reload the page

## Contributing
- Fix typos, add new components, or improve existing styles
- Follow consistent naming (consider renaming "transperent" → "transparent")
